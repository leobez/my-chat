TODO: 
    -> TEST ROLE UPDATE WITH WS

    -> ERROR: WHEN USER GETS MEMBERSHIP REVOKED, HE STILL RECEIVES MESSAGE FROM WS
    IF HE IS IN THE ROOM.

    -> MAYBE SOLUTION: WHEN USER GETS MEMBERSHIP REVOKED, REMOVE (?) HIM FROM ROOM.

TO KNOW: 
    -> IN ORDER TO PASS JWT TOKEN VIA WS WHEN CODING FRONTEND (2 POTENTIAL OPTIONS):
    
        1. TEST IF SOCKET IO CONNECTION REQUISITION DOESNT ALREADY HAVE JWT ON COOKIES. IN THEORY: socket.handshake.headers.cookie

        2. AFTER ACCESSING /register OR /login, PASS JWT AS ARGUMENT ON HEADERS, SO IT CAN BE
        PASSED TO SERVER WHEN CONNECTING VIA WS
    

    -> WHEN CODING FRONTEND, TEST WS FEATURES:

        - 'A NEW USER HAS ENTERED GROUP' MESSAGE
        - WHEN A USER GETS HIS ROLE UPDATED
        - WHEN A USER GETS DELETED FROM A FRIENDSHIP
        - WHEN A USER GETS REMOVED FROM A GROUP
